# Python_guessing-game
A simple python code created as a guessing game. 

The purpose of this project is to create a guessing game using random number for the computer and the user to give advise if the value is too high, too low or just right.

There are 2 parts to this guessing game. 
Part 1: 
A random guess number from 1-10 will be defined.
The user is tasked to guess the correct number and the computer will give hints if the input value is higher or lower than the actual value.

Part 2: 
The user can define a random number from 1-10.
The program will guess the number and the user will provide an input to the computer if the value is too high, too low or correct. 

Hope you like it thank you.
